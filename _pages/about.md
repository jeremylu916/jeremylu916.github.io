Welcome! I'm **Binghang Lu**, a graduate researcher about Large-Language Model (LLM), Generative AI, scientific machine learning and optimization algorithms. I created this website to share my academic work, research updates, and professional materials like my [CV](/files/Purdue.MSECE.Binghang.Lu.Resume.pdf).

I'm currently working on applying advanced deep learning techniques, such as **NSGA-III replica exchange optimization**, to improve the performance of neural networks in solving complex forward and inverse problems in differential equations. I also enjoy exploring real-world applications of AI in areas like materials science and environmental modeling.

Here on my site, you'll find:

- **[Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EFPK9yoAAAAJ&hl=en)** – Papers I've authored or co-authored.
- **[Talks](/talks/)** – Presentations and lectures I’ve given.
- **[CV](/files/Purdue.MSECE.Binghang.Lu.Resume.pdf)** – A downloadable copy of my curriculum vitae.

This website is built using the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted freely with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It allows me to easily manage structured academic content like publications, talks, and teaching material using Markdown.

If you’re a researcher, student, collaborator, or just curious about my work, feel free to explore the sections above. You can also [contact me](/contact/) if you'd like to connect!

Thanks for visiting!
